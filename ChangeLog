- Add the Hash of the key that generated from the --init argument
  to prevent using other keys for new passwords

- Added the beta new argument reader
	Finally! switching to HashMap argument reader :>

- Switched to new arg reader (get out of beta)
	Maybe there will be some problems with it, but it's good to use it instead
	of the old one
